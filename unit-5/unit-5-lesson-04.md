## Key Points

👋 Welcome (5) :
- Welcome students to class and get settled.
- ❌ Do Now: A lot of content for this lesson. May consider breaking this lesson into two sessions - do what fits you and your students needs best.<br><br>

☑️ .createElement (5) :
- The next three section cover the exploration of creating, manipulating, and appending elements in the DOM.
- Instructions on how to use this method to create a new element in the document.
- Include examples of creating different types of elements (e.g., div, p, img) and emphasize the importance of specifying the correct tag name.<br><br>

💬 .innerHTML (5) :

- Include step-by-step instructions and examples, such as creating a new list item and adding it to an existing unordered list.<br><br>

↔️ The DOM & Loops (5) : 
- Demonstrate how loops can be used to efficiently create and manage multiple DOM elements, enhancing the dynamic nature of web pages.
- Break down each step in what happens for each iteration.
- Clarify any gaps along the way.<br><br>

💻 Code Solo (15) : 
- Guide students through coding exercises, applying what they've learned in a practical context. 
- Offer support and encourage experimentation.<br><br>

👋 Exit Ticket & Closing (5)
- Direct students to the Exit Ticket in Google Classroom, ensuring all questions are answered.
